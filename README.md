### About

I care about code that justifies its existence. That means clear intent, minimal indirection, and complexity only where it pays off. I work in C and C++, close to the metal and the kernel, and I prefer tools and abstractions that stay out of the way until they’re needed.

This profile is a snapshot of what I’ve built and how I think—not a resume.

### Selected work

Repositories here are experiments and learning artifacts—things that helped me understand a system, fix a real problem, or explore an idea. I’d rather have a few projects that show deliberate thinking than a long list of templates.

| Project | What it is |
|--------|------------|
| — | *Replace with a repo that matters to you* |
| — | *One line: what you learned or built* |
| — | *Keep the list short and honest* |

### Elsewhere

- **GitHub:** [Bgoost](https://github.com/Bgoost)
- Add links (blog, Mastodon, etc.) only if you use them.
